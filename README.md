Exports sketchup models to the OpenIV Format to import them into GTA IV

Disclaimer
===========

I didn't write the progressbar! But I don't remember where I got it from. All credits go to the original author.

SETUP
===========

Copy sl.rb, the SL_IV_Export folder and the ProgressBar folder into the sketchup plugins folder. Restart Sketchup.
